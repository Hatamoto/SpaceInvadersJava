The game (desktop version) starts with the command java -jar spaceinvaders.jar
from the directory where the jar file is located (project root).

That is the desktop version of the game.

Control your spaceship by moving it left with the A key,
right with the D key and shoot missiles with SPACE.

The objective of the game is to shoot down all the enemy spacecraft
that attack from the top of the screen. If your spaceship collides with an
enemy spacecraft the game is lost.

There is currently no way to restart the game other than closing and
restarting the game using the java command above.
